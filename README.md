# CS525assignment1
assignment 1. read/write block to file on disk

1. What Everyone Did - Makefile and the test cases

Eddie - The writes section and testing.
Yohann - The reads and testing.
Parker - The file creation and handling.
Ashwani - Testing and makefile.
All- Met to fix errors, split tasks and discuss many aspects of the assignment.

2. Do we Need More Tests?
Yes, not all of the methods in my section were covered. I added a test to trigger all of my methods.
I uncovered and error and added ensureCapacity to every write by adding it to one method.

3. Ideas behind our Methods?
The idea was simplicity. We came up with how the system was going to function and based our structure of the
testing methods the professor provided. All reads and writes should assume files are open and
have correct information.

4. Commenting the code. See code.

5. Linux Compiling
Make
./executablename

UNIX Compiling
